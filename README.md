# p2p_car_renting

* Using Bloc.
* CRUDs for Firebase Firestore. Adding car offer, edit, delete...etc.
* Using Dio.
* Using [json_serializble](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable)
  
### Let me tell you where the real catch in the project ###

They told me to request data from Firestore using Dio with raw urls not using Firestore client package like [this](https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore).
